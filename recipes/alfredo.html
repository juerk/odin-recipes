  <h2>Best Homemade Alfredo Sauce is rich, creamy, and packed with garlic parmesan flavor!  This Alfredo Sauce is easy to make and perfect with your favorite pasta!</h2>
  <p>Alfredo sauce is one of my favorite things to have with a big bowl of pasta!  It's a very rich and indulgent treat for dinner.  I also love that it only takes about 5-10 minutes to whip up a batch!  This recipe will yield about two cups of sauce total.  It can easily be doubled if you are feeding a crowd or want extra for later.  The bottled Alfredo just doesn't compare to this delicious homemade version!  If you love cooking from scratch, make some of this Homemade Pasta to go along with your sauce!</p>
