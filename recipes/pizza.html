  <h2>What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!</h2>
  <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
    <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Proof the yeast</li>
    <li>Make and knead the pizza dough</li>
